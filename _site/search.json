While large spikes, which were already common in the Austrian Control Area, were unheard of in Italy, after the 19th of July they became relatively common in Italy too.\n\n\nCode\ncombined_prices %>% \n  ggplot(aes(apg_price, terna_price))+\n  stat_binhex(bins = 50)+\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  ggtitle(\"APG vs Terna (2)\")\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see there is a lot of covariance for extreme values, notice (!) the difference in scale. APG tends to present much extremer imbalance prices.\n\n\nCode\ncombined_prices %>% \n  filter(abs(apg_price) < 300 & abs(terna_price) < 300) %>% \n  ggplot()+\n  geom_histogram(aes(apg_price), alpha = 0.8, fill = \"red\", bins = 200)+\n  geom_histogram(aes(terna_price), alpha = 0.2, colour = \"lightblue\", bins = 200)+\n  theme_bw()+\n  ggtitle(label = \"APG vs Terna (distribution)\")\n\n\n\n\n\nVery surprising - no idea why the distribution is so different.\nUnder normal circumstances/normal price levels for imbalance prices - APG seems to have a much smoother distribution. Terna presents more of a multimodal distribution, peaking around zero and two more peaks - probably values set around the MGP/day-ahead price."
